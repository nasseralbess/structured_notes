# Lecture Notes: Binary Search

## Overview
- Continued exploration of binary search
- Discuss the idea, implementation, and analysis of binary search
- Comparison with linear search
- Additional topics and examples to be covered later

## Key Points from Previous Lecture
- If elements in an array are **not arranged**:
  - **Search Method**: Iterate through elements one by one.
    - Ask if the current element is the target.
    - This approach involves checking each element sequentially.
    
- If elements in an array are **arranged**:
  - We can implement a more efficient searching method.
  - Binary search reduces the number of comparisons significantly.

## Conclusion
- Binary search is preferable over linear search for sorted arrays.
- Further discussion and examples will be presented in the upcoming sections.
